# Dynamic-Routing-Design-in-Faulty-Network
Simulation of a mesh network where nodes and links may fail. Nodes and links may  fail intermittently, as an input to the simulation, each node and link will have a certain probability to fail. When such failure occurs, the network must adapt and re-route to avoid the faulty link/node.
